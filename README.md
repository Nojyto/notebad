# **Notebad - Simple Text Editor**

**Notebad** is a simple text editor built using **Electron**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**. The application features a custom draggable menu bar, tabbed file editing, and basic window controls. This project allows you to create, open, edit, and save text files seamlessly, with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness.
